# EdgeLauncher
Fake EdgeLauncher keylogger made in Python.

Made by George YT9769. Please follow the instructions. This script only supports Windows. BY USING THIS SCRIPT YOU AGREE THAT CREATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR EMOTIONAL DAMAGES. USE ON YOUR OWN RISK.
There might be an issue that it won't work on Win 11 or Python 3.11.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Make sure you have Python installed.

2. Run the SETUP.py file. If this doesn't work, please create an Issue and use "(py -m) pip install -r requirements.txt". If this doesn't work also, download packages manually from that file like this: "(py -m) pip install [package name]"

3. Create a Discord server and make a webhook (https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/how-to-get-started-with-discord-webhooks#where-can-i-find-discord-webhooks).

4. Paste the webhook in EdgeLauncher.py file on line 34 instead of this: [-YOUR WEBHOOK URL-] (If you don't have a Python editor, Right Click > Edit with IDLE > Edit with IDLE 3.X)

5. Now you can start the  EdgeLauncher.py file.

Q&A:

How do I turn off the script? ---> ESC key or through Task Manager.

What can I edit? ---> Exit key, Discord webhook URL, program that will be started (default is Edge), transparency of the window (0 is fully transparent, 255 is opaque), icon (it has to be .ico file, MAX 64x64px)

The program doesn't work. ---> Please create an Issue and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
